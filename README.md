# real_estate_prediction
This repository contains the code for an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting real estate prices. The project follows a comprehensive approach, from data collection to model deployment.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, etc. The project demonstrates the entire data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

Key Features
Data Collection: The project involves gathering real estate data from various sources, including online databases and APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features are applied to prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different features.
Model Building: The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, with Linear Regression being the primary model, to train predictive models on the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance and generalization ability.
Model Deployment: Finally, the best-performing model is deployed to make real-time predictions on new data.
